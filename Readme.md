# Selenium Script Project

This project automates browser interactions using Selenium WebDriver. It includes tests, utilities, and required assets to run the automation scripts efficiently.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd selenium_script
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download WebDriver binaries**:

   - For ChromeDriver: [Download here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)
   - For GeckoDriver (Firefox): [Download here](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)

   Place the downloaded WebDriver binaries in the `drivers/` directory.

### Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
pytest
```

This will execute all the test cases located in the `test/` directory and generate reports in the `reports/` directory.

## Directory Details

- **.pytest_cache/**: Contains cache files generated by pytest for optimizing test runs.

- **assets/**: Stores all necessary assets such as test data, images, and other resources required for the tests.

- **drivers/**: Contains the WebDriver binaries needed to run the tests. Ensure the correct version of WebDriver is placed here.

- **reports/**: Stores the test reports generated after running the tests. These can be in various formats (HTML, XML, etc.) depending on the pytest plugins used.

- **selenium-ide/**: The test format to run using selenium-ide.
